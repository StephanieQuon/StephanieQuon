### Hi, I'm Stephanie ðŸ˜ƒ 

ðŸ“š I'm an electrical and biomedical engineering student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. 

ðŸŽ‰ Currently, I am a Software Engineering Intern @ Microsoft, and a Research Assistant @ BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Bioinformatics Lab.

âœ¨ In the past, I was a CS Teaching Assistant, and a Research Assistant @ Neuroethics Canada, BCCHRI Digital Health Innovation Lab, and BCCHRI Lewis Lab. 

ðŸŒ± In my free time, I value volunteering in the community. I founded The Sprouts Initiative, I volunteer as a Crisis Call Taker with the National Suicide Line, and I help write grants for my local Crisis Centre. I enjoy connecting with people and learning new things.
